                    My journey to become a professional frontend developer has begun in June 2018. <br>
                    I begun this journey with no prior knowledge of any frontend technologies, some basic experience with C# and SQL and a very high level of general computer literacy.<br>
                    I decided to take this step after ten years of a career in building industry because over those years I have been living with a belief that I should have studied Computer Science in the first place and that I am cut out to be a software engineer rather than a building engineer.<br>
                    Now I have decided it is a right time in my life to put this belief to a test.<br>
                    This demo website is as much a showcase of my current skill level as a documentation of my journey. For this reason I will be retaining each of the subpages in it's initial form rather than developing them further as I progress in my journey. I hope that this way I can not only show what I can do, but also how fast and well I can learn.<br>
